A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/hermionejeangranger123/pen/VaMeJJ.

 A mini "Asteroids" game coded from scratch, using some math and black magic.

This is a codepen adapted version of the game, check/fork from this repo: https://github.com/everblind/js-playground at github!

If you want to learn some cool math concepts, check and support this awesome "Coding Math" course: http://www.youtube.com/user/codingmath by Keith Peters

Your feedback will be my pay :)

Cheers!
